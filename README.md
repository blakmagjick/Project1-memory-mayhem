GA SEI Unit 1 final project.

## Project One
For this project, we needed to pick a game to make. 
I decided to go with a matching/concentration game.

And since I couldn't really decide on one theme to go with, I decided to do all three that I was trying to decide between. :) 

Each version of the game has a regular version, and a hard version. From the main page, the regular version loads, but there is a button to go to the Hard Version right at the top.

The regular game has 12 cards, so the player needs to make 6 matches to win. 
And the hard version has 30 cards, so 15 matches are needed to win.

Each of the hard version have the option to play music while playing. And of course, also the option to turn it off again if they player doesn't like the music chose. 

Every version of the game has a "Return to Main Menu" and "Restart" button.

### MVP list
[x] Figure out which pictures I'm using for the game.
[x] Make a grid for the cards.
[x] Figure out how to flip cards.
[x] Figure out how to check if the cards match.
[x] Add scoreboard to game.
[x] Set up messages instead of alerts.
[x] Stylize it.
[x] Make a restart button.

### Stretch Goals
These are the things I added before the presentation.
[x] Allowing the user to pick between 3 different categories of cards to play with (Halloween, vanGogh, Animals)
[x] Have more options for how many cards can be played (Easy, medium, hard?)
[x] Give the option to choose background music

These are the thing I wanted to add, but didn't get them to work before the class presentation. 

- Add a timer option to make the game a little harder, player will need to match all the cards before the timer runs out.
- Two players are playing on the same board, and the winner is who matches the most pairs
- Add fireworks when the player wins
